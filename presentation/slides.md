# Demographics

Let's start with a look at the demographics of this set of people.

    # if only this would work
    select * from people;

It works for a toy dataset though.

The dimensions to look at distributions include

- age
- gender

# Active Users

Don't forget to see how how your population divides among __active__ users. Obviously, you need to define what __active__ means in your context.

- mean # of actions per person
- Weekly active, monthly active

## Simplification

Made a big simplification assumption here. People are equally likely to return. In reality having cohorts who are more likely to return completely changes your test analysis.
